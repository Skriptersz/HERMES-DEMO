# Get Your Salesforce Organization ID (30 seconds)

## Quick Steps:

1. Log into Salesforce
2. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) → **Setup**
3. In Quick Find, type: **"Company Information"**
4. Click **Company Information**
5. Find **"Salesforce.com Organization ID"**
6. Copy the **18-character ID** (looks like: `00D5g000000XXXX`)

That's it! Give me this ID and I'll update the code to use Web-to-Lead (no Connected App needed).
